/*
	Go has the ability to automatically generate documentation for packages we write in a similar way to the
	standard package documentation. In a terminal run
	this command
	
	godoc (path)

	This documentation is also available in web form by running this command:
	godoc -http:=":6060"
	--> https://localhost:6060/pkg/
